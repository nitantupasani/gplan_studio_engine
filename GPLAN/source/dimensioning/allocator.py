"""Area-budget allocator: decide every room's size envelope up front.

Change B of the door_connectivity sizing plan. On the shipped min-dim path
room size is a residue: the solver minimises onto the request minimums and
the gapless fill pushes the plot's leftover area into whichever room can
reach a notch. This module is the missing decision. Given a room list, a
plot and the NBC rulebook it returns, per room, the envelope the room SHOULD
occupy, such that the allocated areas sum to the plot area (when the program
fits). Generation then sends the allocated targets as the solver minimums -
the one lever the solver actually honours - and the minimal-area solution
already fills the plot, leaving the gap fill nothing to redistribute.

Pure function, no solver, no I/O; unit-tested against the worked example in
documentation/plans/DOOR_CONNECTIVITY_SIZING_AND_POSTPROCESS_PLAN.md 4.6.

Clear floor versus rectangle
----------------------------
NBC minimums are CLEAR-FLOOR figures. Walls are drawn centred on the room
rectangle edges (interior 0.4 ft in the designer), so a rectangle loses half
a wall on every side: a 10 x 11.5 rectangle delivers ~9.6 x 11.1 = 107 sqft
of clear floor against a 115 sqft NBC Living Room minimum. The allocator
therefore works in RECTANGLE space throughout: NBC clear bounds are
converted via ``rect_bounds`` (walls added on top, never subtracted), and
because the rectangles tile the plot exactly under the centreline
convention, ``sum(rect areas) == plot area`` holds by construction.

Known residual, deliberate: boundary rooms lose 0.375 ft (half an exterior
wall) rather than 0.2 ft on their outer sides, which the flat allowance
under-counts by up to 0.175 ft per axis. Which rooms are exterior is not
known before layout; ``wall_allowance_ft`` is a request option so the
residual can be tuned once measured.
